# Maze Generator Game

This is a Flutter-based Maze Generator Game application. The app generates a random maze using a depth-first search algorithm and allows the user to navigate through the maze. The application includes a timer to track how long it takes to complete the maze and a "winner" screen that shows the elapsed time when the maze is completed. Users can toggle the maze solution and regenerate the maze as needed. The project follows a modular structure, ensuring code readability and maintainability.
